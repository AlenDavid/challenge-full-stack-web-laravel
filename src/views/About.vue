						The students app challenge requires from the dev to show maestry in
						some skills:
					</p>
					<p class="text-h4">Frontend,</p>
					<p>
						where it was asked - required, this is a challenge - to use
						<a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, a tool that quickly builds a
						website.
					</p>
					<p class="text-h4">Backend,</p>
					<p>
						and now it was asked - required - to use
						<a href="https://lumen.laravel.com/">Lumen</a>, and I love so much
						this micro-framework ❤️!
					</p>
					<p class="text-h4">Database,</p>
					<p>
						we could use Postgres or MySQL, and I choose MySQL 'cause I can
						query stuff quicker.
					</p>
					<p class="text-h4">Deployment,</p>
					<p>
						This was tricky and exceptional. If someone is fullstack it has to
						know how to build stuff. But this person can create value for people
						beyond it's own computer?
					</p>
					<p>last, but not least</p>
					<p class="text-h4">Leadership.</p>
					<p>
						It's hard to find someone who can launch a ready-to-use app in less
						then 30 hours of coding.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the scope of one week (considering 2h/weekday, plus
						8h/weekends, I only coulde get 26 hours of work), part of the
						challenge was to determine what parts of the project scope must be
						in production before other parts. This kind of decision is even
						trickier then deployment 'cause requires knowledge in how much I can
						code in such environment.
